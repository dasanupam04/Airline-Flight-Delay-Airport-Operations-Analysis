## 📌 Project Overview
Flight delays and cancellations are the result of complex interactions between airline operations, airport infrastructure, and system-level constraints. This project presents a **data-driven analytical solution** using **interactive dashboards** to clearly separate and explain:

- Airline operational performance  
- Airport congestion and infrastructure impact  

The dashboards are designed to enable **accurate attribution of delays**, support **root-cause analysis**, and improve **data-backed decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze flight delays and cancellations from multiple perspectives  
- Distinguish airline-driven inefficiencies from airport-driven constraints  
- Identify dominant delay and cancellation contributors  
- Enable dynamic, scenario-based exploration using dashboards  

---

## 📊 Project Structure

The analysis is intentionally divided into **two independent dashboards**, each answering a distinct analytical question.

---

### 1️⃣ Airline Flight Delays Dashboard

**Focus:** Airline-level operational performance and reliability.

#### Key Analytical Areas
- On-time arrival and departure performance trends  
- Airline-wise cancellation rate comparison  
- Ground operations efficiency through taxi time analysis  
- Delay cause decomposition (airline, weather, system, late aircraft, security)  
- Scenario analysis using time, distance, and cancellation-reason filters  

#### Core Insight
> Airline delays are primarily driven by operational interdependencies and schedule ripple effects rather than isolated external disruptions.

---

### 2️⃣ Airport Analysis Dashboard

**Focus:** Airport-level congestion, infrastructure constraints, and systemic delay drivers.

#### Key Analytical Areas
- Arrival, departure, and taxi time analysis at the airport level  
- Identification of high-traffic and congested airports  
- Airport-wise cancellation cause distribution  
- Day-of-week and airline-specific congestion patterns  
- Geographic visualization of delay and traffic concentration  

#### Core Insight
> Airport congestion and capacity limitations significantly amplify delays through multi-factor systemic interactions.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach
- KPI-driven visual analytics instead of raw metrics  
- Proportional analysis to ensure fair comparisons  
- Clear separation of airline and airport responsibilities  
- Root-cause analysis over surface-level reporting  
- Interactive filters for scenario-based exploration  

---

## 🏗️ Data Understanding
The dataset consists of:
- Flight-level operational records  
- Airline identifiers  
- Airport identifiers and geographic coordinates  
- Delay and cancellation classifications  
- Temporal attributes (date, month, day of week)  

Flights act as transactional records linking airlines and airports while preserving analytical independence.
