Flight delays and cancellations impact airline profitability, passenger satisfaction, and airport efficiency.  
This project presents an **end-to-end data analytics case study** that uses **interactive Power BI dashboards** to analyze flight delay patterns from **two critical perspectives**:

- Airline operational performance  
- Airport congestion and infrastructure constraints  

The project focuses on **root-cause analysis**, **fair performance comparison**, and **decision-support analytics** rather than static reporting.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Airline delays are often misattributed due to overlapping responsibilities between airlines, airports, and national air systems.  
This case study addresses the challenge:

> *How can flight delay data be analyzed to accurately separate airline inefficiencies from airport and infrastructure-driven constraints?*

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify key drivers of flight delays and cancellations  
- Compare airline performance using proportional KPIs  
- Analyze airport congestion and systemic delay contributors  
- Enable scenario-based analysis using interactive dashboards  
- Support operational and strategic decision-making  

---

## 🧩 Solution Approach
The solution is structured into **two independent analytical dashboards**, each designed to answer a specific business question.

---

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Airline Flight Delays Analysis

### Purpose
Evaluate **airline-level operational reliability** and understand how scheduling and operational dependencies influence delays.

### Key Analyses
- On-time arrival and departure performance trends  
- Airline-wise cancellation rate comparison  
- Taxi time analysis to separate ground vs air inefficiencies  
- Delay cause decomposition (airline, weather, system, late aircraft, security)  
- Distance- and time-based scenario exploration  

### Business Insight
Airline delays are largely caused by **schedule ripple effects and late aircraft dependencies**, rather than isolated external disruptions.

---

## 📊 Dashboard 2: Airport Operations & Congestion Analysis

### Purpose
Analyze **airport-level infrastructure stress** and its impact on flight delays and cancellations.

### Key Analyses
- Arrival, departure, and taxi time performance at airports  
- Identification of high-traffic and congested airports  
- Cancellation reason distribution by airport  
- Day-of-week congestion patterns  
- Geographic visualization of delay concentration  

### Business Insight
Airport congestion and capacity limitations significantly **amplify delays through systemic interactions**, especially at high-traffic hubs.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Methodology
- KPI-driven analytics instead of raw counts  
- Proportional metrics for unbiased comparison  
- Separation of airline vs airport accountability  
- Root-cause and scenario-based analysis  
- Interactive filtering for dynamic insights  

---

## 🏗️ Data Understanding
The dataset includes:
- Flight-level operational records  
- Airline and airport identifiers  
- Delay and cancellation classifications  
- Geographic coordinates  
- Temporal attributes (date, month, day of week)  

Flights are treated as transactional records connecting airlines and airports while preserving analytical independence.

## 💡 Business Impact

### For Airlines
- Improve schedule robustness  
- Reduce delay propagation  
- Optimize aircraft rotation planning  

### For Airports
- Identify congestion bottlenecks  
- Improve runway and gate utilization  
- Support infrastructure planning  

### For Regulators & Planners
- Detect systemic constraints  
- Enable data-driven policy decisions  
- Improve airspace efficiency

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualization)  
- KPI Design & Dashboard Architecture  
- Data Analytics & Operational Analysis  

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaway
This case study demonstrates how **analytics-driven dashboards** can transition from reporting tools to **strategic decision-support systems** in complex operational environments.
