Flight delays and cancellations are the result of complex interactions between airline operations, airport infrastructure, and system-level constraints.
This project delivers a data-driven analytical solution using interactive dashboards to clearly separate and explain:

    Airline operational performance
    
    Airport congestion and infrastructure impact

The goal is to enable accurate attribution of delays, improve operational understanding, and support data-backed decision-making.
